<h3 style="color: red">Instruction part 1 begins</h3>

To find your github avatar HTML source code, you need to first view the source code of your Github profile page (please go google "how to view the source code of a webpage", and it is very easy to apply), then you need to use the built-in pointer tool of your browser to locate and click on your Github avatar area, then you will be lead to a HTML source code section in a form like :

```html
<img style="height:auto;" alt="" width="260" height="260" class="avatar avatar-user width-full border color-bg-default" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103571424?v=4">
```

Next, please just copy the value of the `src` part and pasted it in the corresponding area above in your [**about**](https://deep0thinking.github.io/2nd-Minima/about.html) page, after completing that procedure, your avatar on your personal website [**about**](https://deep0thinking.github.io/2nd-Minima/about.html) page will sync with the one on your Github profile page. And finally you can delete this instruction part (from `<h3 style="color: red">Instruction part 1 begins</h3>` to `<h3 style="color: red">Instruction part 1 ends</h3>`) safely.
