<h4 id="0.1">0.1 About the 2nd-Minima repository</h4>

This Github repository is designed for the people who want to build a personal website handily (based on [Jekyll-theme-Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)) but are not familiar with front-end programming languages.

To be more specific, it is an advanced modified-version **template** of personal websites based on [Jekyll-theme-Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

And here is a [**2nd-Minima**](https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima) based website sample: [Deep0Thinking.github.io](https://deep0thinking.github.io)

![Deep0Thinking.github.io](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/589368822/c878cee3-1b76-4852-a06a-f8a773679ff5)

<h4 id="0.2">0.2 About the "/README.md"</h4>

This "[**/README.md**](https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima/blob/master/README.md)" file is considered to be a manual or handbook for the [**2nd-Minima**](https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima) repository. I would try to explain everything as I can to help you to understand it and modify it according to your preference.

<h4 id="0.3">0.3 About the usage</h4>

Briefly, you could do almost any modification based on this template as you want according to the [MIT License](https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima/blob/main/LICENSE) in both [**2nd-Minima**](https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima) and [Jekyll-theme-Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

<h4 id="0.4">0.4 About the acknowledgement</h4>

I would like to thank all the developers and contributors of the [Jekyll-theme-Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), because the [**2nd-Minima**](https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima) is an advanced personal-website-template repository that developed mainly based on the [Jekyll-theme-Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

And specifically, great thanks to [Long Qian](http://longqian.me/aboutme/), [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) and [giscus.app](https://giscus.app) for providing supportive tool and code for the community!

Thanks should also go to Github, because this platform provide many people (including me) a chance to learn, cooperate and improve in coding.

Finally, special thanks to my family and friends, without their support in every aspect, I would never accomplish this.  

Oh, and a big thank to you too, I really appreciate that you trust me and use it :)

<h3 id="1">1 Basic set up</h3>

<h4 id="1.1">1.1 Use this template</h4>

Please enter the [**2nd-Minima**](https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima) repository page first and click on `Use this template` (the green button) -> `Create a new repository` , then please enter the "Repository name", if this is your first time creating a repository, I recommend you to type in the form of "Your-Github-name.github.io" like "Louis.github.io", for more detailed explanation please check here: https://pages.github.com . But if you want to use other repository names like "Cookie-0111", it's totally acceptable and will not cause any difference or problem on the future use.

And for other setting selections you could just leave them as default, or you could make your own choices based on your preference. (BTW, others could still access to your personal website as long as you've deployed this repository's webpage and they also got its link address, even though you choose `private` when creating the repository at first)

<h4 id="1.2">1.2 Webpage deployment</h4>

Please enter the page of the repository which you've just created using the [**2nd-Minima**](https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima) template, then please click on `Settings` (above the green button) -> `Pages` (on the left column list) -> `None` -> `master` -> `Save`. And after about 1 minute, your personal website will be generated successfully, BTW you can always check its deployment state through access your repository Github main page to see whether that little yellow point (next to the green button `< > Code`) has turned into the âœ… (and please keep refreshing the page) .

And you can visit your site at `Settings` -> `Pages` -> `Visit site` , and don't forget to remember your website address :)

In fact, you could save the address on your browser, or put that address into your repository's `About` block which is next to the green button `< > Code` on your repository Github main page by clicking the option button (the gear icon) in that `About` block, or create a clickable link combines with the heading in your "**/README.md**" file under the repository, like `# [please-paste-your-webpage-link-here](https://please-paste-your-webpage-link-here)` , and next time you can conveniently click on that heading on your repository Github main page to access your webpage since Github has set the "**README.md**" file of every repository to display automatically on their corresponding repository's Github main page.

<h3 id="2">2 Usage</h3>

<h4 id="2.1">2.1 "/_config.yml"</h4>

First, please open the "**/_config.yml**" and replace the `Please-type-your-Github-name-here` with your Github name in the title part.

Next, for line with `the show_description` , I recommend you to leave its value with `true` , and don't worry, we will help you to figure that out later.

And for the `header_pages` , this part controls the display order of the pages on the navigation bar of `archive` , `about` and `all-tags` pages, you can change their sequence to affect their real display sequence on the webpage: the order of top to bottom in the `header_pages` corresponds to order of left to right on the webpage navigation bar.

<h4 id="2.2">2.2 Posts</h4>

Want to write a post including texts, a picture, a youtube video, links to other website, Maths equations (latex), a downloadable document link, others comments, interactive animations, and etc?

Now please go to check the [How-to-post-posts](https://deep0thinking.github.io/2nd-Minima/2022/11/28/How-to-post-posts.html) post :), it is under the "**/_posts/**" folder.

<h4 id="2.3">2.3 giscus.app</h4>

I think you've noticed the **fake comments section** on the bottom part of the post of "**How to post posts**", this is actually the area that you would need to establish your **real comments section**.

In fact, the real comments section is supported by [giscus.app](https://giscus.app). Please check that out, the [giscus.app](https://giscus.app) page have already written detailed information and instructions to enable the comments section (giscus).

When you finish reading the [giscus.app](https://giscus.app) instructions and have copied the embed code for the comments section (giscus), you can now paste it and replace the **fake comments section** code (which is located at bottom of the file: `<h1><a href="https://github.com/Deep0Thinking/2nd-Minima#2.4">fake comments section</a></h1>` ) in your "**/_layouts/post.html**" file. And you also need to apply the same process to the your "**/about.md**" and "**/archive.md**" file, yeah I also put the **fake comments section** there respectively.

Maybe you would wonder why can't I just put the giscus embed code in the "**/_layouts/page.html**" (since the [**about**](https://deep0thinking.github.io/2nd-Minima/about.html) and [**archive**](https://deep0thinking.github.io/2nd-Minima/archive.html) pages all have `layout: page` in the Predeclaration part) ?

In fact, it is valid for you to do that, but I don't recommend this action because it would also cause the and [**all-tags**](https://deep0thinking.github.io/2nd-Minima/all-tags.html) and every single **tag** page to have the comments section at the bottom and that is not necessary and would somehow decrease the webpage aesthetics from my perspective.

After completing the procedure above, you can now see the comments sections (giscus) appear at the bottom part in the corresponding pages.

<h4 id="2.4">2.4 "/about.md"</h4>

The instruction of modifying [**about**](https://deep0thinking.github.io/2nd-Minima/about.html) page are provided inside the "**/about.md**" file, so you can now visit your "**/about.md**" file and do some personalized modification.

<h4 id="2.5">2.5 "/archive.md"</h4>

The instruction of modifying [**archive**](https://deep0thinking.github.io/2nd-Minima/archive.html) page are provided inside the "**/archive.md**" file, so you can now visit your "**/archive.md**" file and do some personalized modification.

<h4 id="2.6">2.6 favicon</h4>

Favicon is the icon that represents your webpage and you can design your own favicon for your webpage, here I recommend [favicon.io](https://favicon.io), it is a website that allows you to design and generate your favicon freely and conveniently. After you've done creating your favicon, all you need to do it to put the generated "**favicon.ico**" file under the "**/favicon/**" folder ***(Attention: The file name of that favicon file you put under the "**/favicon/**" folder must be "**favicon.ico**" exactly, or it won't work)***, then your webpage would be able to show the favicon you designed.
